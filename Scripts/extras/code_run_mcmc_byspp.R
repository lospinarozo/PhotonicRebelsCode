# This function is custom written to run MCMCglmm on all 1300 trees of beetles 
# We include the function here to keep the main RMarkdown tidy.

# This function includes only 1 random factor:
# 1) phylogeny ("phylogeny_name")
# In this function, we first run 1300 iteration (nitt = 1300, burnin = 0, thin = 1) to kick it running. 
# The last iteration is saved as the starting values of the run on the next tree.
# Next, we repeat 1300 times (nitt = 2000, burnin = 1999, thin = 1.) 
# but discard the first 300 times as burn in.
# The method is adapted from Stuart-Fox et al. 2021 (Ecology Letters, 24, 2207â€“ 2218).
